## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: DeepSeek API (FREE - Recommended)

2. Sign up for a free account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Option 2: OpenAI API (Paid)
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Add billing information and payment method
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

# OR OpenAI API Configuration (Paid)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
