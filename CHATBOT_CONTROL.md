# 🤖 Chatbot Control Guide

## How to Control What Your AI Chatbot Says

Your chatbot is now configured with strict controls to prevent false claims and ensure accuracy. Here's how to manage it:

## 📁 **Main Configuration File**
Edit: `/src/app/config/chatbot-config.ts`

This file controls everything the AI can say. Update it whenever you want to change:
- Company information
- Services offered
- Response templates
- Topics to avoid

## 🔧 **Quick Updates**

### **Add a New Service**
In `chatbot-config.ts`, add to the `services` array:
```typescript
{
  name: "Your New Service",
  description: "Brief description",
  details: "More detailed explanation"
}
```

### **Update Response Templates**
In `chatbot-config.ts`, modify the `responses` object:
```typescript
responses: {
  pricing: "Your custom pricing response",
  results: "Your custom results response",
  // ... etc
}
```

### **Add Company Information**
Update the `company` object:
```typescript
company: {
  name: "Your Company Name",
  founder: "Your Name",
  email: "your-email@domain.com",
  // ... etc
}
```

## 🛡️ **Built-in Safeguards**

The AI is programmed to:
- ✅ **Never make specific claims** about results or savings
- ✅ **Never promise guarantees** or specific outcomes
- ✅ **Always redirect pricing** to demo bookings
- ✅ **Never make up** client names or case studies
- ✅ **Say "I need to check"** when unsure
- ✅ **Stay neutral** on competitor questions

## 🚨 **What the AI Will NOT Say**

- Specific performance metrics (e.g., "We save 80% of time")
- Exact pricing numbers
- Made-up client testimonials
- Guaranteed results
- Specific implementation timelines
- Competitor comparisons

## ✅ **What the AI WILL Say**

- General benefits of automation
- Your verified services
- Encouragement to book demos
- Professional, consultative responses
- "Results vary by business" for results questions
- "Let me connect you with our team" for complex questions

## 🔄 **How to Update**

1. **Edit the config file**: `/src/app/config/chatbot-config.ts`
2. **Save the file**
3. **Restart your dev server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test the chatbot** to see changes

## 📝 **Example Updates**

### **Add a New Service**
```typescript
{
  name: "Email Marketing Automation",
  description: "Automated email campaigns and customer segmentation",
  details: "Set up automated email sequences, customer segmentation, and personalized marketing campaigns."
}
```

### **Update Pricing Response**
```typescript
pricing: "Our automation solutions start at $500/month for basic packages, with custom enterprise solutions available. I'd recommend booking a demo to discuss your specific needs and get accurate pricing."
```

### **Add Contact Information**
```typescript
company: {
  phone: "+1-555-123-4567",
  address: "123 Business St, City, State 12345"
}
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Keep it factual** - Only include verified information
2. **Be conservative** - Better to under-promise than over-promise
3. **Redirect complex questions** - Let humans handle detailed discussions
4. **Test regularly** - Check the chatbot's responses after updates
5. **Monitor conversations** - Review what customers are asking

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

After making changes, test these questions:
- "What services do you offer?"
- "How much does it cost?"
- "What results can I expect?"
- "How long does implementation take?"

The AI should give safe, professional responses that direct complex questions to your team.
