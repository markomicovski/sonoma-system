## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- ✅ **Environment variables ready**
- ✅ **API keys working** (tested locally)
- ✅ **Safety controls in place**
- ✅ **Demo mode fallback** configured

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment**

1. **Visit your live site**
2. **Click the chat button** (bottom-right)
3. **Test these questions:**
   - "What services do you offer?"
   - "How much does it cost?"
   - "I want to book a demo"
   - "What's your contact information?"

## 🔄 **Updating the Chatbot**

To update the chatbot after deployment:

1. **Edit the config file:** `/src/app/config/chatbot-config.ts`
2. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update chatbot responses"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Auto-deploy** (Vercel/Netlify will automatically redeploy)

## 🛡️ **Security Notes**

- ✅ **API keys are secure** (stored as environment variables)
- ✅ **No sensitive data** in the code
- ✅ **Rate limiting** handled by API providers
- ✅ **Error handling** prevents crashes

## 📊 **Monitoring**

- **Vercel:** Check the Functions tab for API call logs
- **Netlify:** Check Functions tab for serverless function logs
- **Railway:** Check the Logs tab for real-time monitoring

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **Test thoroughly** on the live site
2. **Monitor performance** for the first few days
3. **Update responses** based on customer questions
4. **Add more services** as you expand
5. **Consider analytics** to track chatbot usage

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

**If the chatbot doesn't work:**
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify API keys are valid and have credits
3. Check the hosting platform's function logs
4. Test the API endpoint directly

**If responses are wrong:**
1. Update `/src/app/config/chatbot-config.ts`
2. Redeploy the site
3. Clear browser cache and test
